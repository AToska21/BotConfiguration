    "One possibility is that you've installed NamelessMC within a subdirectory, you only can do this on v2. A requirement for the package to function is that the files are installed directly into your root directory, or you use a subdomain to point to the subdirectory.\n\n",

    "1. Edit **/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf** (or whichever conf file corresponds to your Nameless installation)\n",
